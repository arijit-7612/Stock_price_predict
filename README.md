Intro Image :
Include an image representing stock market forecasting or trends.

Introduction:
Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction using LSTM project! This repository provides all code and resources for predicting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Through the power of deep learning, this project aims to forecast stock prices to support investment decisions.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to utilize historical stock data to train an LSTM model. By learning from past trends, the model identifies patterns, capturing long-term dependencies ideal for time series forecasting tasks, making it a robust tool for stock market analysis.

Dataset Description:
The dataset used is publicly accessible and consists of historical stock prices across different companies. It includes essential stock details such as opening and closing prices, trading volume, and dates, which help the model in capturing relevant patterns for better accuracy.
